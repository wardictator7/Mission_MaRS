# MaRS Club Recruitment Coding Set

Welcome to the MaRS Club Recruitment Coding Set! This repository contains a curated list of coding problems categorized by difficulty to help you prepare for easy navigation. This helped me gain an insight on the work performed by the software team and just scaled my interests to next level in robotics.

A small truth...I am uploading the files in last day. So, I wasnot able to learn to upload the files from terminal. Instead I directly uploaded from the GitHub website.

## Overview

This set includes:
- **2 Easy Problems** – Basic Linux
- **5 Medium Problems** – Logic and algorithms in python
- **2 Hard Problems** – Autonomous Navigation and Behaviour Tree


## Code Breakdown

Each code is commented to a extent to be understandable with good use variable naming.

## Learning Experiance

I want to break it down into 2 parts. The first part for which I actually needed help which includes the basic linux codes/bash script and Behaviour Trees. Actually these exercises increased my depth in this field and I felt a sense of accomplishment of learning something new. As far as the other codes are concerened I already had the required knowledge and ideas for doing it, so not much of a learning in that. Overall, I had a fun experience which sparked a increasing interest for me in the field of robotics and coding. 

## MazeRover Experience

It was a amazing experience being there for maze rover. I had a intro to simulations using **Gazebo** and autonomous navigation systems. It was fun doing the simulations manually and as far as autonomous navigation is conserned, I had barely enough time to code by then. I used AI for the codes, and I went through it so that I could answer the questions about it if asked. I did get the hold of the coding part and it gave me the interest to do more. I carrired out this undone business after the competition and it went okayish ( I just learnt to move the rover and carry out some turns). I decided to learn this in depth during the vacations and master it to a extent.
